# GC_Ball_Motion
Automatically detect speed of a rotating ball from video


## BallMotionAnalysis.m

For calculating speeds from a single video

**Input:** Video and various constants below

**Output:** Trial speeds (pix/sec) 3 seconds before and 3 seconds after each trial (in variable 'trialSpeed'). 

Note: Hard coded for 60fps capturing camera


**Flowthrough:**
1. Add video name (must be mp4)
2. Update stim_start_frame, end_frame
3. Load in .mat file containing trial timestamps into the workspace (used to align frames to trial)
3. Setup to 0, find the correct values for thresh_circle and thresh_line by trial-and-error (use cntrl-c to stop execution to update values, repeat until correct)
4. Setup to 1, run fully


*Change the following constants:*

```
VID_NAME = name of video, without '.mp4'
STIM_START_FRAME = frame with start of the first stimulus (can tell by seeing reflection of gratings on ball)
END_FRAME = last frame that you want to capture (aprrox when the sessions ends)
MAXIMUM_SPEED (def 40) = max pix distance you want to set as ceiling, can vary depending on camera quality
THRESH_CIRCLE = [x-coord,y-coord,radius], the parameters for the circle outside of which all identified circles will be discarded
THRESH_LINE = [m,b], the slope and x-intercept for line above which all identified circles will be discarded
% [m,b]
% x = m*y + b

SETUP = either 0 or 1; 0 when trial-and-error testing thresh_circle and thresh_line (outputs a debugging figure), 1 when running fully (no debugging output)
```

## SerialBallMotionAnalysis.m, SerialBallMotionAnalysisStart.m

Used to process many ball motion videos, say overnight. Bascially, find individual constants for each video using the file above, and then arrange them into individual arrays in the "start" function. I never really used this very much.
